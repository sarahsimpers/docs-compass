========================================
Adjust Maximum Time for Query Operations
========================================

The :guilabel:`MAX TIME MS` query bar option sets the cumulative time
limit in milliseconds to process query bar operations. If the time
limit is reached before the operation completes, |compass-short|
interrupts the operation.

The default :guilabel:`MAX TIME MS` value is 60000, or 60 seconds.
Consider raising this value if you have a very large collection, or
your operations are frequently timing out. You can also consider creating
:ref:`indexes <compass-indexes>` to improve query performance.
